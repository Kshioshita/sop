			From the very first moment I met you, you became a <span>man</span> that I couldn't forget. I always know <span>where I'm at</span> with you. You've helped me organize my life by teaching me to <span>make directories</span> and <span>list</span> those who have cluttered my past, even those who I've forgotten about and are <span>invisible</span>. Even when I wanted to grow and <span>change</span> you were by my side. When I wanted to <span>move</span> our relationship to the next level, you easily <span>copied</span> my lead. You've even learned to <span>auto complete</span> my sentences; or at least <span>try your best</span>. Every time we <span>touch</span> we add something new to our lives. Even getting to know your <span>cat</span> has allowed my to read you like a book. I hope I'll never have to <span>remove</span> you from my life!
			<br>Love,
			<br>Kaylin
