		<h1>Dear GitHub,</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>
			Thank you for <span>repo</span>sitioning yourself in my life. You've become an essential part of my life. You can easily <span>read me</span> and understand my needs. Despite the <span>push</span> and <span>pull</span> of our relationship, I'm a better person because of you. I would even go to a <span>remote</span> island with you, with only a <span>fork</span> in hand. That would definitely <span>merge</span> us for life. I <span>request</span> that this relationship lasts forever.
		</p>
