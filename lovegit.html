		<h1>Dear Git,</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>
			<span>Initially</span>, I was hesitant about our relationship. I didn't want to <span>commit</span> too much to you, but you kept leaving me <span>messages</span>. I soon realized that the <span>staus</span> of our relationship was evolving. I kept wanting to <span>add</span> you to my future. The <span>log</span> of the time we spent together kept growing. The list of <span>differences</span> between us kept getting smaller. I was no longer able to <span>branch</span> off in other directions. I only wanted to <span>create a new branch</span> with you. I never found myself <span>checking out</span> other people. I feel like going <span>back in time</span> when I'm with you. We should <span>merge</span> our lives together. You've helped me <span>delete painful branches</span> from my past. I will never <span>push</span> you away again.
			<br>Love,
			<br>Kaylin
